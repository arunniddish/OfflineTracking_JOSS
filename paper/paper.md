# Summary

MarkerVision is an open-source MATLAB toolbox that enables vision-based pose estimation of robots using inexpensive webcams and colored fiducial markers. It provides an accessible, low-cost solution for tracking the position and orientation of mobile or articulated robots without requiring specialized motion capture systems. The toolbox offers modular functions [@arun1987least] for camera calibration, color-based marker segmentation, and 2D/3D pose computation, making it suitable for experimental robotics, education, and reproducible research workflows.

# Statement of need

Precise pose estimation is essential for evaluating robot locomotion, control algorithms, and interaction with the environment. Commercial tracking systems (e.g., Vicon, OptiTrack) are often prohibitively expensive, limiting accessibility for many research labs and educational institutions. Existing open-source alternatives can require complex setup or specialized hardware. MarkerVision addresses this gap by providing a simple, MATLAB-based approach that only relies on commodity webcams and readily available colored markers, lowering the barrier for vision-based tracking in robotics research.
